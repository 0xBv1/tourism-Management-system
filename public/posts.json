The Great Temple, engulfed by a vast sand dune, receded from memory. By the 6th century BC, the sand concealed the temple's statues up to their knees, burying their grandeur and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">history<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Abu Simbel Temple<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Europeans remained oblivious to its existence until March 1813, when a Swiss researcher named Johann Ludwig Burckhardt stumbled upon the small temple and glimpsed the top frieze of the main temple.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>Where is the Abu Simbel Temple Located?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Abu Simbel temple stands in the village of Abu Simbel in the Aswan Governorate of Upper Egypt, close to the Sudanese border. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Abu Simbel Temple Location<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rests on the western bank of Lake Nasser, roughly 230 km (140 mi) southwest of Aswan (about 300 km (190 mi) by road).<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span>\r\n<h3>which pharaoh was ordered to build the Abu Simbel Temples in Aswan?<\/h3>\r\n<b><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Commissioned by <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ramses_II\">Pharaoh Ramesses II<\/a> in the 13th century BC, they were dedicated to the ancient Egyptian gods Ptah, Amun, and himself as a form of sun deity.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Abu Simbel Sun Festival<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67434 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Abu-Simbel-Sun-Festival.jpg\" alt=\"Abu Simbel Sun Festival\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The sun illuminates Abu Simbel's Temple with an outstanding solar alignment during the equinoxes,\u00a0 so that on February 22 and October 22 each year (<\/span><strong>Abu Simbel Sun Festival<\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">),<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the rising sun's rays penetrated the inner sanctuaries and illuminated three statues on the back wall, an impressive sight. As both architectural wonders and monuments to power, the Abu Simbel Temples represent the heights of New Kingdom artistic achievement and royal vanity, continuing to inspire millions of visitors today.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>The Architecture of Abu Simbel Temples<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67444 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/The-Architecture-of-Abu-Simbel-Temples.jpg\" alt=\"The Architecture of Abu Simbel Temples\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The temple's design is an amazing showcase of the grandeur of ancient Egyptian civilization. This impressive structure stands 30 meters tall and stretches 35 meters in length. As you enter, you'll be greeted by four colossal statues portraying Ramses the Great seated on a throne, towering at 20 meters (65 feet). Below these imposing figures, smaller statues illustrate Ramses defeating enemies, honoring and protecting gods and family.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Upon entering, you'll find an image of Ramesses II seated on a throne, wearing the double crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Inside, three consecutive halls span a remarkable 56 meters (185 feet). The hypostyle hall, boasting a width of 16.7 meters and a height of 18 meters, is supported by eight massive Osiris pillars, symbolizing Ramses as the ruler of the underworld Osiris and emphasizing the pharaoh's eternal nature.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">In the central chamber, you'll discover statues representing various gods, adorned with depictions of the pharaoh, scenes from his victory at the Battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC (marking the first recorded peace treaty in history), and more. On the fa\u00e7ade, a row of 22 baboons with raised arms worships the rising sun.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The inner sanctuary houses the four seated gods of Ramses II\u2014Ptah (God of creation), Amun (The Creator God), and Ra (Sun God)\u2014playing a central role in the sun festival. Not far from the great temple, the Nefertari temple, a charming architectural masterpiece, sits 100 meters northeast. Decorated with two groups of colossi separated by a large gateway, it features two statues of the queen and six statues of her husband, King Ramses II, standing at 10.5 meters (35 feet). These statues pay homage to \"Hathor,\" the goddess of love, allure, and joy, the sky falcon Horus, and Maat, the goddess of Justice, among others.<\/span>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\"><b>The Love-Infused Wonders of Abu Simbel\u2019s Small Temple:<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The enchanting Small Temple of Abu Simbel, a monument to love and devotion, is nestled just 100 meters northeast of the grand temple of Ramesses II. This sacred site honors the divine goddess Hathor and the esteemed queen Nefertari, Ramesses II\u2019s beloved consort. Remarkably, it stands as only the second instance in the storied annals of ancient Egypt where a temple is consecrated to a queen, echoing the earlier tribute by Akhenaten to his cherished royal wife, Nefertiti.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">As you approach, be captivated by the temple\u2019s rock-hewn facade, graced by two majestic groups of colossal statues, divided by a grand entranceway. Towering over 10 meters tall, these impressive effigies depict the regal couple\u2014Ramesses II and Nefertari. Flanking the gateway, witness the dual representations of the pharaoh: to the south, adorned with the pure white crown of Upper Egypt, and to the north, with the illustrious double crown, both complemented by the elegant figures of the queen.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Burckhardt shared his astounding find with Italian explorer Giovanni Belzoni, who ventured to the site but struggled to unearth an entryway into the temple. Undeterred from revealing the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">history<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of Abu Simbel Temple<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Belzoni returned in 1817 and triumphantly achieved access to the enigmatic complex. A vivid account of the temples, accompanied by contemporary line drawings, can be found in Edward William Lane's Description of Egypt (1825\u20131828).<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The tale of Abu Simbel is one of loss and rediscovery, where time's relentless march shrouded ancient marvels in oblivion. Yet, through the tenacity of explorers and the pages of historical accounts, the splendor of these temples was resurrected, allowing us to peer into the secrets of a bygone era.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>The Relocation of Abu Simbel Temples<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67435 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/The-Relocation-of-Abu-Simbel-Temples.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>Why Was Abu Simbel Temple in Aswan Relocated in<\/b><b> The 1960s?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">The Relocation of Abu Simbel Temples<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> In 1959, was an urgent mission that unfolded as the rising waters of the Nile threatened the ancient relics of Nubia.

With a budget of $40 million (equivalent to $377.42 million today), they set out to salvage the magnificent Abu Simbel temples.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Over four arduous years, an extraordinary feat unfolded. Piece by colossal piece, some weighing up to 30 tons (averaging 20 tons), the temples were meticulously cut, dismantled, and raised to safety.

In Hebrew, it\u2019s known as \u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05db\u05e0\u05e1\u05ea \u05d1\u05df \u05e2\u05d6\u05e8\u05d0, and in Arabic, it\u2019s referred to as \u0645\u0639\u0628\u062f \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0632\u0631\u0627. Local legends suggest that this is the very place where Moses was discovered as an infant.\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sun Pyramids Tours, 1970, the most innovative travel agency in Egypt, is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">inviting you to embark on a remarkable journey through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/egypt\/cairo\/attractions\/ben-ezra-synagogue\/a\/poi-sig\/406234\/355225\">Coptic Cairo and Ben Ezra Synagogue<\/a>.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Experience the splendor of Coptic Cairo, where majestic churches and the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ's sacred sites.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The Ben Ezra Synagogue, once a vibrant center for Jewish festivities, congregations, and devotions in Egypt, has evolved into a point of interest for tourists following the departure of the majority of the Jewish community in the 1950s.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt;\"><b>When was Ben Ezra Sanygouge established?<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Origins The exact date of the establishment of the Ben Ezra Synagogue remains uncertain. However, documents discovered in the genizah suggest that it was likely established before 882 CE, possibly during the pre-Islamic era.<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">In 882, a church and its surrounding property were sold by the patriarch of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria to a Jewish group. Some scholars in the 19th century speculated that this transaction marked the birth of Ben Ezra. However, the purchasers were adherents of the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia, while Ben Ezra was a congregation that followed the teachings of the competing Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina. Contemporary scholars concur that the synagogue sold in 882 was a different one.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The location of the Synagogue is also steeped in biblical lore, believed to be the very spot where the Pharaoh\u2019s wife discovered and rescued baby Moses from his river-bound basket.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Ben Ezra Synagogue Facts<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67420 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Ben-Ezra-Coptic-Cairo.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Ezra - Coptic Cairo\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">In the 19th century, a remarkable discovery was made in the synagogue\u2019s genizah, or storage room. A wealth of Hebrew, Aramaic, and Judeo-Arabic manuscripts, and more than 250,000 historic papers, both secular and sacred, that had been lost and stored away were found, turning the synagogue into a treasure trove of historical documents.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The refurbishment process involved careful architectural conservation efforts on the walls and ceiling, as well as an overhaul of the lighting system, according to the statement.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Boasting an impressive array of books and documents that offer a glimpse into the societal life of Egyptian Jewish communities, the Ben Ezra Synagogue is of considerable significance in the study of modern Jewish history.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>When was Discovered in Ben Ezra Synagogue<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Jacob Saphir, a Romanian-born Jew who moved to Ottoman Palestine during his childhood, later became a rabbi. In 1859, he embarked on a global journey to fundraise for the restoration of Jerusalem\u2019s Hurva Synagogue, which had been demolished by authorities in 1721. Saphir was the first to acknowledge the historical importance of the geniza at Ben Ezra Synagogue, a fact he documented in a book published in 1874.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The first European to access the geniza was Jewish book collector Elkan Nathan Adler in 1888, who acquired approximately 25,000 documents. During the synagogue\u2019s reconstruction from 1889 to 1892, the documents were piled up in the open. Count Riamo d\u2019Hulst, an Egyptologist, examined some of these documents during this period.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">In December 1896, Solomon Schechter, a Cambridge University instructor who later became a renowned American rabbi, initiated the first thorough scholarly study of the geniza documents. He also arranged for the remaining documents to be transferred from Cairo to various university libraries.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\"><strong>Ben Ezra Synagogue Architecture<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<b>\u00a0<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The synagogue\u2019s doors were officially opened by Egypt Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly on September 2023, marking the completion of a decade-long restoration project, as reported by the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities (MOTA).<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The latest refurbishment was carried out by the Drop of Milk Association, an entity dedicated to the preservation of Egypt\u2019s Jewish heritage.

It is home to the royal burial ground from the pre-dynastic era, which has unveiled intriguing connections with Sumeria. Additionally, it houses the Osireion, a mysterious subterranean chamber linked to the Nile, constructed from massive blocks. The architectural style of these blocks is only paralleled by the Valley temple at Giza. Later, the temple of Seti I from the Sixth Dynasty, which undoubtedly originates from an earlier period, was constructed atop this site.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Where is the Abydos Temple located, and how to get<\/strong><strong> there?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67403 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Great-Temple-of-Abydos.jpg\" alt=\"Great Temple of Abydos\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">The Abydos Temple is situated in the town of Abydos, which was once a prominent sacred city and a necropolis for the earliest Egyptian royalty. Abydos was also a pilgrimage hub for worshipping Osiris, the god of the afterlife, who was thought to be buried there. To reach Abydos from Luxor, you can take a private car or a taxi, which will take approximately two and a half hours. Alternatively, you can join a guided tour that includes transportation and entrance fees with Sun Pyramids Tours. Contact Us for more information. You can also combine your visit to Abydos with another nearby temple, such as Dendera or Karnak<\/span>.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 14pt; color: #000000;\"><b> The Temple of Seti I (1,307-1,291 BC)<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">(The house of millions of years) It is considered to have been built towards the end of Seti's reign.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Temple_of_Seti_I_(Abydos)\">Seti I<\/a>, the second king of the 19th Dynasty, was the son of Ramesses I and Queen Sitre. He reconciled with the Hittites, who were becoming the most powerful state in the region. Seti I and his heir, Ramesses II, campaigned against Kadesh. In Karnak, he completed his father's plan by converting the court between the second and third towers into a vast hypostyle hall. He built his vast mortuary complex at Abydos.\u00a0<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The renowned structure that stands today is often referred to as <a href=\"https:\/\/arce.org\/temple-seti-i-abydos\/\">the Grand Temple of Abydos<\/a>. The elevated reliefs in this splendid Temple are among the finest in all of Egypt. This Temple boasts a unique design, resembling an inverted \"L.\" It also houses the most comprehensive lists of Kings and Gods.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The Temple houses seven sanctuaries dedicated to 7 Gods: Osiris, Isis, Horus, Amon Ra, Ra HorAkhty, Ptah, and Seti I as a deified King. In this Temple, one can find the best-preserved painted reliefs and texts from the 18th Dynasty.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Seven chapels were constructed for the worship of the pharaoh and primary deities. At the rear of the Temple is a mysterious structure known as The Osirion, believed to be associated with the worship of Osiris, and likely from those chambers extended the grand Hypogeum for the celebration of the Osiris mysteries, constructed by Merenptah.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67404 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/kinglistlong.jpg\" alt=\"king list long\" width=\"360\" height=\"270\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The Temple of Seti I is also gaining a reputation for its unique carvings discovered on one of its ceiling beams.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67405 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/1_CiBxHLO7CwSYbnC_Oxb7EA.jpg\" alt=\"The Abydos ''Airships''\" width=\"577\" height=\"193\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These engravings have garnered considerable interest in the past due to their striking resemblance to contemporary vehicles. However, it\u2019s been proposed that they might be the result of superimposed hieroglyphs, which, despite their rarity, seem plausible when examining the rest of the beam.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67406 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Abydos-Osireion.jpg\" alt=\"Abydos-Osireion\" width=\"235\" height=\"275\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">The construction of Seti I\u2019s Temple occurred significantly later than the Osireion :<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">It\u2019s believed that Seti I was guided to construct at this site and that he adjusted the temple\u2019s direction upon discovering the Osireion. However, the alignment of the two temples suggests that he likely knew about the Osireion\u2019s existence when he initiated the construction of his temple.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> The Osireion (Strabo's Well, The Fountain of Abydoss)<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67409 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/osireion-temple.jpg\" alt=\"osireion temple\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">When Seti-I initiated the quest for a site for his Temple, he was guided to a spot north of Luxor in the Nile River\u2019s curve. Here, he started excavating the foundation for his Temple. During this process, he stumbled upon the Osireion, the ancient temple of Osiris. Whether he was aware of the Osireion\u2019s existence remains a mystery, but upon encountering this ancient temple in his new temple\u2019s path, he redirected his new temple to the left. This temple is the only one in Egypt that takes an \u2018L\u2019 turn.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The structure<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> has notable architectural disparities from the temple above and is presumed to be considerably older. It bears several resemblances to the 'Valley Temple' at Giza, which is also acknowledged as an early-dynasty edifice. Pertaining to this matter, it may be noteworthy that the temple Osireion is consecrated to Osiris, while the 'Valley temple' at Giza is linked to Isis.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">As of now, we lack any clues regarding the construction date. However, the design, the magnitude of the materials, and the total lack of ornamentation all suggest a very ancient origin. Until now, the so-called Sphinx temple at Gizeh has always been regarded as one of Egypt\u2019s oldest structures. It is contemporaneous with the pyramid of Chefren\u2026<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Given its similar composition but much larger materials, the Abydos reservoir exhibits an even more archaic character, and it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if this turned out to be Egypt\u2019s oldest structure.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Who was Dorothy Eady (Omm Sety), and what was her connection to the Abydos Temple?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67411 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Dorothy-Eady-Omm-Sety.jpg\" alt=\"Dorothy Eady (Omm Sety)\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">One of the most fascinating stories about the Abydos Temple is that of Dorothy Eady (1904 \u2013 1981), also recognized as <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dorothy_Eady\">Omm Sety<\/a> or Om Seti, who was a British custodian of antiques and a folklorist. She served as the guardian of the Abydos Temple of Seti I and worked as a draughtswoman for the Department of Egyptian Antiquities. She gained fame for her conviction that she had been a priestess in ancient Egypt in a past life and for her extensive historical research conducted at Abydos. Her life and contributions have been the focus of numerous articles, TV documentaries, and biographical works.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">According to John A. Wilson, the late head of the Oriental Institute and regarded as the \u201cdean of American Egyptology\u201d by his peers, believed that Omm Sety merited recognition as \u201ca responsible scholar.\u201d She served as a resource for contemporary scholarship aiming to comprehend how traditional ancient religious customs have endured into the present day, manifesting as \u201cfolk customs\u201d observed by modern Egyptian Copts and Muslims. Unlike others who professed to be reincarnated entities from ancient Egypt, she was accorded respect by Egyptologists. While none publicly endorsed the phenomena she described, none questioned her honesty, and many have utilized her insights on past and present Egypt as credible source material.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Ramesses II Temple<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67412 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Ramesses-II-temple.jpg\" alt=\"Ramesses II temple\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The neighboring temple of Ramesses II, although smaller and simpler in design, boasted a remarkable historical series of scenes on its exterior that celebrated his accomplishments, with the lower parts still intact. The temple\u2019s exterior was adorned with depictions of the Battle of Kadesh. A list of pharaohs, akin to that of Seti I, once stood here; however, the fragments were acquired by the French consul and sold to the British Museum. The top two rows of the list feature the names of the kings, while the third row repeats Ramesses II\u2019s throne name.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67413 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/12\/Ramesses-II.jpg\" alt=\"Ramesses II\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What are the opening hours of The Abydos Temple<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The opening hours of The Abydos Temple are:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Daily from 7 AM to 6 PM<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why do I book with Sun Pyramids Tours<\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>1) Expertise and Experience:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Sun Pyramids Tours has a wealth of 53 years of experience in the travel and tourism industry.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>2) Customized Itineraries: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sun Pyramids Tours offers tailored itineraries to suit your preferences.

But when is the best time to visit this captivating country? It depends on what you\u2019re looking for.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to enjoy the sun and the sand, winter is the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.lonelyplanet.com\/articles\/best-time-to-visit-egypt\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Time to Visit Egypt<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. From December to February, you can unwind on the beaches, admire the pyramids of Giza, and cruise on the Nile. The weather is mild and cozy, making it perfect for outdoor activities.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">If you want to avoid the heat and the crowds, spring and autumn are the best seasons to visit Egypt. From March to May and from September to November, you can explore the temples and tombs at your own pace and enjoy the moderate temperatures.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Egypt is a land of endless possibilities, where you can discover its rich history and culture, its stunning nature and wildlife, and its friendly and hospitable people. Whatever season you choose, you\u2019ll find something to suit your taste and budget.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best Time for sightseeing in cooler temperatures<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">October - February<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-67278 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Best-for-sightseeing-in-cooler-temperatures.jpg\" alt=\"Best Time for sightseeing\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b>How do you enjoy Egypt\u2019s ancient and natural attractions in the coolest season?<\/b>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The Perfect Time to Discover and Relax In the Northern European winter, many travelers (and tour groups) flee the gloomy skies back home to enjoy the beaches of Sharm el-Sheikh and the Red Sea coast this time of year<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, is the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best time to travel to Egypt.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">You\u2019ll experience pleasant weather across most of the country, although in Cairo and Alexandria, expect some rain. Suppose you\u2019re here to explore Luxor\u2019s abundance of Pharaonic wonders. In that case, winter brings clear skies and cozy daytime temperatures to make long days of wandering around ancient ruins a delight rather than a challenge.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0Best time to travel to Egypt and the<\/span>\u00a0most popular season to venture into the Sinai or the Western Desert for outdoor adventures (from hiking to camel trekking) or to soak up the winter sun while learning to dive in South Sinai and along the Red Sea coast. Divers should note that sea conditions can be rough on boat dives around December, but shore dives are usually fine.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">In Cairo, the mild weather makes November an excellent time for long walks to admire the capital\u2019s madrassas and mosques. Be aware it will be chillier than you might think (especially after dark), so you also need to pack something warm. Finally, be ready to pay more for accommodation during the winter high season, especially around Christmas and New Year.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best <\/strong><strong>Time <\/strong><strong>for warm temperatures and gentle breezes<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>March - May, September - early October<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67287 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Best-Time-for-warm-temperatures.jpg\" alt=\"Best Time for warm temperatures\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<strong>How do you experience Egypt\u2019s highlights with fewer crowds and more comfort?<\/strong>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Visiting Egypt during the shoulder season can give you the best of both worlds. Major monuments are less crowded, and you can often find a good deal on accommodation.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Daytime temperatures can be scorching in May and September, so shoulder season travelers who prefer cooler weather (and families with young children) should opt for March, April, or October instead.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The weather is usually comfortable, so you can enjoy a full day outside from late September to October. This is Egypt\u2019s best travel season. It\u2019s also a good time for diving. The light along the Nile is soft and clear, ideal for photography in Luxor and Aswan. In the Western Desert oases, the date harvest is in full swing.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In April, the khamsin can still be a problem, but when it\u2019s not blowing, this is a near-perfect and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best time to travel to Egypt<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The warmer evenings make it especially good for overnight felucca trips from Aswan and camping in the White Desert.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">May is usually a good time for package deals to resorts like Sharm el-Sheikh, Hurghada, El Gouna, and Marsa Alam.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The best time to visit for the start of summer<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>June: August<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67289 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/The-best-time-to-visit-for-the-start-of-summer.jpg\" alt=\"The best time to visit for the start of summer\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b><i>How do you enjoy Egypt\u2019s ancient wonders and dive paradise in the hottest season?<\/i><\/b><\/span>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The weather becomes scorching as the average high temperature reaches 108\u00b0F (42\u00b0C). Luxor\u2019s temples and tombs open at 6 am, so you can still beat the heat by being an early bird.<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">You may hear a joking \u201cWelcome to Alaska!\u201d in Aswan. Unless you\u2019re very resilient, it\u2019s better to avoid the Western Desert.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Summer is when avid divers flock to Sharm el-Sheikh and the Red Sea coast. They don\u2019t mind the baking heat on land, as they enjoy the calm, warm sea conditions and excellent underwater visibility. You can dive in Egypt all year round, though.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Just to break the low season rule, summer is the peak domestic holiday period along the Mediterranean coast, as half of Cairo escapes to the beach. Yes, it\u2019s still hot in Alexandria, but at least there\u2019s a breeze.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>How do you travel during<\/b> Ramadan<b> in Egypt?<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67291 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/travel-during-Ramadan-in-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"How do you travel during Ramadan in Egypt?\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When to Travel to Egypt, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the dates for Ramadan (the month when Muslims fast during daylight hours) vary every year as the Islamic calendar follows the lunar cycle.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">If you're traveling during Ramadan, keep in mind that tourist sites, as well as most shops and services, have shorter hours, and many non-tourist-oriented restaurants and cafes only open after sunset.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Best Times to Visit Egypt for a Nile Cruise<\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67292 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Best-Times-to-Visit-Egypt-for-a-Nile-Cruise.jpg\" alt=\"Best Times to Visit Egypt for a Nile Cruise\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong>How do you choose the best time to experience Egypt\u2019s river of life?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Embarking on a Nile cruise, primarily between Luxor and Aswan, offers an unparalleled opportunity to explore Egypt, often referred to as \u201cthe cradle of civilization.\u201d<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The optimal time for a Nile Cruise for the most pleasant experience is during the mild season, which spans from December to February.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">If you\u2019re considering a family vacation to Egypt during the festive period of Christmas and New Year, a Nile cruise can provide an unforgettable experience and a celebratory ambiance. You\u2019ll get to partake in the festivities with the crew, fellow vacationers, and your family.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Taking into account both the climate and budget considerations, the most favorable times for a Nile Cruise are during the warm seasons, from March to April and October to November. These periods offer fewer crowds, more affordable prices compared to the peak season, and comfortable temperatures for outdoor exploration.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">If your travel plans include the peak season, it\u2019s recommended to secure your flight and hotel bookings at least six months in advance. This helps avoid potential stress related to temporary price hikes and sold-out rooms or seats. Opt for a journey with Sun Pyramids for a seamless, personalized tour, regardless of your travel dates.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Egypt has a hot and dry climate, with mild winters and scorching summers.

From its early days as a center of Hellenistic culture to its later role as a crucible for religious and intellectual exchange, Alexandria has left an indelible mark on global beliefs. This article explores the city's profound influence on Hellenism, Judaism, early Christianity, and Islam, shedding light on its enigmatic legacy.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sun Pyramids Tours, 1970, the most innovative travel agency in Egypt, is inviting you to visit Alexandria and promising you an unforgettable Christian Monuments exploration to the most sacred and spiritual places all over Egypt. <\/span><b>Contact us now<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or Continue the article to find more helpful knowledge and packages.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before we delve into the depths of Alexandrian history, it must be noted that this article is not meant to be a narration of ordinary historical events that take place on the coasts of this Mediterranean city. And if you notice that at the beginning of the article, you must know that this historical narration is just an introduction to explain the mysterious and enigmatic influences of this Ancient city on the world's ideas and beliefs.<\/span><\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Foundation and Medieval growth<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67243 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Alexandria-City-in-Medieval-growth.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria City in Medieval growth\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Alexandria, founded by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, served as the capital of his new Egyptian territory and a strategic naval base. Its location, with access to abundant water and a natural harbor provided by the island of Pharos, made it an ideal choice.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Under the Ptolemies, Alexandria experienced a golden age, merging ancient Greek and Egyptian religions in the cult of Serapis. Within a century, Alexandria became a prominent Mediterranean city and a hub of Greek scholarship and science.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The Mouseion, a renowned research institute founded by the Ptolemies, attracted notable scholars like Euclid, Archimedes, and Ptolemy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Alexandria boasted a celebrated library that housed numerous Greek texts, while a subsidiary library was established at the temple of Serapis. Unfortunately, the main library was destroyed during a civil war under Roman emperor Aurelian in the late 3rd century CE.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">The city also hosted a significant Jewish community and played a vital role in Jewish learning. The translation of the Old Testament into Greek, known as the Septuagint, was produced in Alexandria. However, the diverse ethnic and religious groups present in the city led to frequent interethnic strife during this era.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Alexandria City At Roman and Byzantine periods<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-67244 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Alexandria-City-At-Roman-and-Byzantine-periods.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria City History\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the Roman and Byzantine eras, as the Ptolemies\u2019 power waned in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE, Rome ascended to prominence. Alexandria became a pivotal player in the political machinations that led to the formation of the Roman Empire.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cleopatra, the final Ptolemaic ruler, famously wooed Julius Caesar in Alexandria and professed to have given birth to his child. Despite her efforts to revive the Ptolemaic dynasty, Caesar\u2019s murder and her ill-fated backing of Mark Antony against Caesar\u2019s grandnephew, Octavian, thwarted her plans. In 30 BCE, Octavian, who later became Emperor Augustus, officially annexed Alexandria and Egypt into the Roman Empire. The city was strategically important as it controlled access to Egypt\u2019s grain reserves, which Rome increasingly depended on.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><strong>Alexandria in Islamic period<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67246 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Alexandria-in-Islamic-period.jpg\" alt=\"Alexandria in Islamic period\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.britannica.com\/topic\/Islamic-world\">Islamic period<\/a> is While Alexandria capitulated to the Muslim Arab expansion without resistance, the conquest led to a significant departure of the Greek population\u2019s leading elements. From then on, apart from a brief interlude in 645 when the Byzantine fleet temporarily retook the city, Alexandria\u2019s fate was intertwined with the political and cultural developments in Islam. Alexandria was politically overshadowed by the new Arab capital at Al-Fus\u1e6d\u0101\u1e6d (later absorbed into the modern capital, Cairo); the Coptic Patriarchate was moved there from Alexandria in the 11th century. However, Alexandria continued to prosper as a trading hub, mainly for textiles and luxury goods, as Arab influence extended westward through North Africa and into Europe. The city held importance as a naval base, particularly under the F\u0101\u1e6dimids and the Maml\u016bks, but it had already begun to reduce in size, reflecting its new, less grandiose status. The Arab walls, which were reconstructed in the 13th and 14th centuries and dismantled in the 19th century, enclosed an area that was less than half of the Greco-Roman city\u2019s expanse.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size: 24pt;\"><b>Evolution of the modern city<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-67254 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/alexandria-attractions.jpg\" alt=\"modern Alexandria\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the city\u2019s historical landmarks are a crucial draw, Alexandria\u2019s stunning contemporary side is something tourists will swiftly become enamored with. From the newly built Bibliotheca Alexandrina (a library and cultural hub that also serves as an interactive tribute to the vanished \u201cGreat Library\u201d) to the lively downtown area and Corniche waterfront district, there\u2019s a plethora of sights to captivate visitors. As you journey through present-day Alexandria, make sure to try the fresh seafood (a trip to the Alexandria Fish Market comes highly recommended), embark on a boat excursion on the River Nile, and explore the central Souq Ibrahimiyya; it might not be as bustling as the markets in Cairo, but it\u2019s certainly worth a visit!<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Alexandria\u2019s Enigmatic Influence on Global Beliefs<\/span><\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b> Gnosticism<\/b><\/h4>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the ancient world, Alexandria, Egypt, served as a significant hub for cultural exchange and learning, contributing notably to the evolution of Gnosticism. This religious and philosophical movement, which surfaced during the early Christian era, drew from a broad spectrum of traditions and ideas, including Egyptian mysticism and Greek philosophy.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Alexandria, Platonic and Neoplatonic philosophies, which were widespread in the city, influenced the Gnostics. They also engaged with the local Jewish and Christian communities, enabling them to integrate aspects of these traditions into their own doctrines. The Gnostics were recognized for their focus on spiritual knowledge (gnosis) and the concept that the physical world is inherently defective, with salvation attainable through the acquisition of this knowledge. These notions were partially shaped by the Gnostics\u2019 exposure to Alexandria\u2019s diverse intellectual and spiritual customs.<\/span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n \t<li>\r\n<h4><b>Hermatism<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\r\n<\/span><\/h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hermeticism is often discussed within the context of Alexandria, a city of great significance in the classical world and a hub for various philosophical and spiritual traditions. Alexandria, one of the most bustling cities in classical Egypt, was renowned for its Library and educational institutions.<\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gilles Quispel, in his preface to Salaman\u2019s Way of Hermes, confirms the existence of a secret society in Alexandria, similar to a Masonic lodge, before and after the dawn of the Christian era.

In that case, it means that you can see Luxor attractions like the Karnak temple complex, Luxor Temple, Ramsium, Habu city, Dendra, and Abydos temples in middle Egypt as you move through the north until you reach the Giza Plateau with its magnificent pyramids, Sphinx, and the Wadi Temple, and all the modern attractions as you reach Cairo such as the Grand Museum of Egypt, Coptic Cairo with its old churchs that some have been built by Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ himself, and for sure Islamic Cairo including historical Mosques, medieval streets and forts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou should take care of the weather as it is getting a bit cold as you sail down to the north, so prepare yourself with windbreakers and scarfs, but don\u2019t worry, Egypt is still a warm place as it still belongs to Africa.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What Is The Best Time To Cruise The Nile River?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66892 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/What-is-the-best-time-to-cruise-the-Nile-River_.jpg\" alt=\"What is the best time to cruise the Nile River?\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/What-is-the-best-time-to-cruise-the-Nile-River_.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe best time to cruise the Nile River depends on your preferences and budget. Generally speaking, there are two main seasons for cruising the Nile River: winter and summer.\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Winter (October to April)<\/b>: This is the peak season for cruising the Nile River, as the weather is mild and pleasant, with average temperatures ranging from 15\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C. The winter season also coincides with significant festivals and events in Egypt, such as Christmas, New Year, Coptic Easter, and Sham el-Nessim. However, winter is also the most expensive and crowded season, as many tourists flock to Egypt to escape the cold weather in their home countries. You may need to book your cruise well in advance and expect higher prices and longer queues at the attractions.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><b>Summer (May to September)<\/b>: This is the low season for cruising the Nile River, as the weather is hot and dry, with average temperatures ranging from 25\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C. The summer season also coincides with Ramadan, the holy month of fasting for Muslims, which may affect some of the services and activities in Egypt. However, summer is also the cheapest and least crowded season, as fewer tourists visit Egypt due to the heat. You may find great deals and discounts on your cruise and enjoy more space and privacy at the attractions.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<h3><b>\r\n<\/b><b>\r\n<\/b><b>Nile Cruise Outfit Suggestions<\/b><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMany travelers wonder what to wear on a Nile cruise when they plan a trip to Egypt that includes sailing along the Nile River. Nile River cruises have no formal dress code. You can dress as you like, even on luxury Nile cruises.\r\n\r\nYour Nile cruise attire will depend mainly on the time of year you visit. You should dress casually but smartly in the evenings, especially for dinner. You can choose how to dress during the day, but the weather will also affect your decision.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>What to Wear on a Nile Cruise during Winter?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEgypt\u2019s winter months are December, January, and February. Egypt can get quite cold in winter, especially in the morning and at night.\r\n\r\nAverage daytime temperatures in Upper Egypt are usually higher than in places like Cairo and Alexandria, while average nighttime temperatures are often lower.\r\n\r\nWe recommend packing a light jacket or cardigan for winter Nile cruises in case you get cold during the day. We also strongly recommend packing a warmer and heavier jacket for the evenings if needed.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3><b>What should you wear on a Nile Cruise during summer?<\/b><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEgypt\u2019s summer months are June, July, and August. You can expect extreme heat in summer. You need to dress appropriately for the summer heat if you visit during this time of the year.\r\n\r\nWe recommend wearing long pants that are loose-fitting and lightweight for summer Nile cruises. We also recommend wearing lightweight, long-sleeved shirts. Female Travelers can also wear long, loose-fitting dresses instead.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThis will help you stay relaxed and comfortable and also protect you from the sun. You can dress however you want, but tight-fitting clothing can make you feel very uncomfortable in the summer heat.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/h3>\r\nTravelers who want to experience the ancient history and culture of Egypt can enjoy a Nile cruise, which offers a relaxing and scenic way to explore the river\u2019s many attractions.

Whether you are looking for a relaxing or adventurous night out, Hurghada has something for everyone. Here are some tips and ideas on how to spend the night in Hurghada and answers to frequently asked questions about Hurghada nightlife.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What are the best things to do in Hurghada at night?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66749 size-full lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Hurghada-Marina.jpg\" alt=\"things to do in Hurghada at night\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Hurghada-Marina.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHurghada offers a wide range of things to do at night, such as:\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Visit Hurghada Marina<\/strong>: Hurghada Marina is a beautiful modern marina that comes alive in the evening. Side by side are restaurants, bars, and shops. One of the best things to do in Hurghada at night is to visit Hurghada Marina at sunset. It\u2019s such a beautiful experience to watch the sun slowly sink into the Red Sea.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Experience the nightlife<\/strong>: As soon as darkness descends, Hurghada transforms from a sleepy resort town into a vibrant party town. Hurghada is one of the leading nightlife cities in Egypt. There\u2019s a large selection of discos, nightclubs, and bars serving colorful drinks and playing loud music throughout the city. Some resorts and hotels even have their very own discos and nightclubs. So why not enjoy a fun night out in Hurghada? For your safety, however, you should never go out alone at night in Hurghada. Always make sure to go out in groups.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Visit a Bedouin village<\/strong>: If you\u2019re looking for an authentic thing to do in Hurghada at night, I highly recommend joining a tour of a Bedouin village. Here, you\u2019ll be able to explore the Bedouin lifestyle in a small town in the desert. There are many different tours from Hurghada. Most major hotels and resorts offer trips to the Bedouin villages. When visiting a Bedouin village on time, you usually dress in their clothes. You\u2019ll then be invited into a tent where you\u2019ll be offered a tasty feast with traditional Egyptian dishes. On most tours, you can also attend an oriental show and listen to local songs.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>See a show<\/strong>: As in most other popular resort towns worldwide, Hurghada offers many entertaining shows. You\u2019ll be able to find everything from dance shows and concerts to magicians and more. Several of the major hotels and resorts in Hurghada offer weekly shows to their guests. It\u2019s a good idea to investigate whether the show includes animals to avoid supporting animal cruelty.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\"><strong>Astronomical night trip<\/strong>: One of the best things to do in Hurghada at night is to go on an astronomical night trip in the desert. These tours start after dusk when you\u2019re driven out of the city and into the lonely desert. Here, you\u2019ll get a completely clear and undisturbed view of the starry night sky without disturbance from the city light.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What is the best time to visit Hurghada?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66751 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/time-to-visit-Hurghada.jpg\" alt=\"best time to visit Hurghada\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/time-to-visit-Hurghada.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHurghada has a hot and dry climate, with mild winters and scorching summers. The best time to visit Hurghada is from October to April, when the weather is more relaxed and comfortable. Avoid the peak season of December and January, when higher prices and crowds are more significant. The summer months of May to September are scorching and dry, making sightseeing difficult and unpleasant. However, if you don\u2019t mind the heat, you can find cheaper deals and fewer tourists during this time.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How many days do I need to explore Hurghada?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66754 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/How-many-days-do-I-need-to-explore-Hurghada_.jpg\" alt=\"How many days do I need to explore Hurghada?\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/How-many-days-do-I-need-to-explore-Hurghada_.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question depends on how much you want to see and do in Hurghada. A typical itinerary for a day tour in Hurghada would cover one or two main attractions in one city or region. For example, you can visit the beach, snorkeling, or dive in Hurghada. However, if you want to see more of Hurghada\u2019s diversity and beauty, you may need more days to cover different destinations. For example, you can combine Hurghada with Cairo or Luxor on a day trip or overnight tour or add other places such as Alexandria, Petra (Jordan), Jerusalem (Israel), or Istanbul (Turkey) for an extended time.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>How to get a visa to visit Egypt?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66780 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/How-to-get-a-visa-to-visit-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"How to get a visa to visit Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/How-to-get-a-visa-to-visit-Egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMost visitors need a visa to enter Egypt, which can be obtained online or on arrival. You also need a valid passport with at least six months of validity. To apply for an online visa (e-visa), you need to fill out an application form on [the official website], pay a fee of $25 for a single-entry ticket or $60 for a multiple-entry visa, and receive your visa by email within five working days. To get access on arrival (VOA), you must pay a fee of $25 at any Egyptian airport or border crossing, fill out an application form, and receive your visa sticker on your passport. The visa is valid for 30 days from the date of entry.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>What Should I Pack For My Hurghada Tour?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66781 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/pack-for-Hurghada-tour.jpg\" alt=\"pack for Hurghada tour\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/pack-for-Hurghada-tour.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHere are some tips on what to pack for your Hurghada tour:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Bring comfortable shoes, hats, sunglasses, and water bottles for walking and exploring. The sun in Hurghada can be extreme and cause sunburns or heat strokes.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Bring sunscreen, insect repellent, and medication for common ailments. The water quality in Hurghada could be better and may cause stomach problems or infections. You should avoid raw or uncooked food, such as salads, fruits, or seafood, and only eat at reputable restaurants or hotels.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Bring a camera, a phone, a charger, and an adapter for your electronic devices. The electricity in Hurghada is 220 volts and 50 Hz, and the plugs are type C or F. You may need an adapter or a converter to use your devices.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"1\">Bring some cash in Egyptian pounds (EGP) for tipping and small purchases. Tipping is expected and appreciated in Hurghada, especially for guides, drivers, porters, waiters, and other service providers. You can tip around 10% of the bill or more, depending on the quality of service. You can also exchange your currency at banks, hotels, or exchange bureaus or withdraw money from ATMs.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Why do you book with Sun Pyramids Tours?<\/strong><\/h3>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">1) Expertise and Experience: Sun Pyramids Tours has a wealth of 53 years of experience in the travel and tourism industry.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">2) Customized Itineraries: Sun Pyramids Tours offers tailored itineraries to suit your preferences.

One way to embrace these sentiments is through travel. Year-end journeys have become increasingly popular, with many travelers seeking unique destinations filled with thrilling activities and itineraries. Egypt has emerged as a favored destination for December holidays, offering classic tours from Cairo and Nile River cruises (sailing between Luxor and Aswan).\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDecember is also a time for Christmas celebrations. Recognizing that most people observe Christmas on December 25, many tourist attractions and hotels organize special events during this period. So, if you\u2019re seeking a festive and extended Christmas holiday from mid-December to January, Egypt is the perfect destination!\r\n\r\nThe pinnacle of both Christmas and New Year\u2019s celebrations are the special dinners hosted in hotels or on River Nile Cruises. And let\u2019s not forget the country\u2019s iconic landmark \u2013 the Giza Pyramids, which are illuminated by the reflection of fireworks as the year turns. Additionally, on New Year\u2019s Eve, numerous hotels host dinners featuring performances by renowned local artists.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>The History Of Coptic Christmas<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66684 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/history-of-coptic-in-egypt.jpg\" alt=\"The history of Coptic Christmas\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/history-of-coptic-in-egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEgypt is said to be the origin of the Christmas festival, including the Christmas tree. Egyptians used twelve-limbed palm trees to symbolize a completed year at the winter solstice, a tradition our Christmas tree is believed to trace back to. Interestingly, the birthdays of their sun deities were celebrated on this day.\r\n\r\nThe sacred month of Kiahk is when Coptic Christmas occurs. If you find yourself in Egypt during this time, it\u2019s recommended that you do not miss this beautiful celebration. Every Saturday, worshippers partake in a special liturgy, praying with lovely songs that enliven the mass.\r\n\r\nA unique fast is observed by the faithful for 43 days leading up to Christmas, from November 25 to January 6. This natural vegan diet called the \u201choly feast of the Nativity,\u201d involves abstaining from meat and all its derivatives. However, exceptions can be made for those who are too weak or have health concerns.\r\n\r\nAccording to popular statistics, most foreigners celebrate Christmas and New Year in Egypt at the Red Sea in Marsa Alam and Sharm El Sheikh. They enjoy the tranquil waters of the Sea and marvel at the vibrant coral reef beneath the Sea.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Egyptian Coptic Christmas<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66685 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Egyptian-Coptic-Christmas.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptian Coptic Christmas\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Egyptian-Coptic-Christmas.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn the lead-up to Christmas, or Kiakh, as it\u2019s known among Coptic Christians, the month is filled with unique customs. Predominantly, every Saturday night, hymns of praise echo through Coptic Christian churches. As dawn breaks around 5 am, Sunday Mass commences.\r\n\r\nWhy not embark on a day-long adventure with our Old Cairo Tour to discover Cairo\u2019s ancient churches?\r\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/tour\/day-tour-to-coptic-cairo-and-cave-church-start-from-50\/\">Day Tour To Coptic Cairo and Cave Church<\/a>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMoreover, starting from November, 45 days before Christmas, a distinct dietary regimen commences. This diet, devoid of any animal-derived products, including butter, mirrors a vegan lifestyle. It\u2019s a form of bodily discipline known to Christians as \u201cthe fast of the Nativity.\u201d Themes such as discipline, sacrifice, giving, and extending kindness to others are emphasized.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Christmas Celebrating Traditions in Egypt<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66687 aligncenter lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Christmas-Celebrating-Traditions-in-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Christmas Celebrating Traditions in Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Christmas-Celebrating-Traditions-in-Egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJust as in the rest of the globe, Christmas in Egypt is marked by food, decorations, traditions, and celebrations!\r\n\r\nThe majority of Egyptian Christians are members of the Coptic Orthodox Church, which has its own unique Christmas customs.\r\n\r\nMost Egyptian Christians are Orthodox and celebrate Christmas on January 7, following a 45-day fast from November 25 to the evening of January 6. During this period, meat, poultry, and dairy products are avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the run-up to Christmas, Christian homes and churches are adorned with trees, lights, and miniature nativity scenes. On Christmas Eve, everyone dresses in new attire and heads to church, ready to partake in the festive joy.\r\n\r\nAt the grand St. Mark\u2019s Cathedral in Cairo, the Orthodox Church\u2019s Pope commences the ceremony at 11 pm. Once the Christmas service concludes, people return home to enjoy an exceptional meal known as Fata, which includes bread, rice, garlic, and boiled meat.\r\n\r\nVisiting friends and neighbors and sharing a sweet treat called Kahk is a traditional practice. Interestingly, this confection is also enjoyed by Muslims during Eid El Fitr, which follows Ramadan.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>New Year\u2019s Eve in Egypt is All You Need To know<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66688 size-full lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Egyptian-Christmas.jpg\" alt=\"New Year\u2019s Eve in Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Egyptian-Christmas.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\nEmbarking on a holiday journey as the year concludes is a delightful blend of food, decorations, traditions, festivities, and a diverse array of experiences.

Egyptian cuisine is influenced by the geography, climate, culture, and history of the country and by the cuisines of neighboring countries and regions. Egyptian food uses fresh ingredients, aromatic spices, legumes, vegetables, and bread. In this article, we will introduce you to some of the most delicious and popular types of Egyptian food that you should try when you visit Egypt.<\/span>\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 18pt;\">Bread<\/span><\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-67142 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Bread.jpg\" alt=\"Bread\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400; font-size: 12pt;\">Bread is a staple food in Egypt and an essential part of every meal.

Aish Baladi is used to scoop up dips, sauces, and stews or to make sandwiches with various fillings. Other types of bread in Egypt include:<\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Aish Shamsi<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A white flatbread made from refined wheat flour that is softer and thinner than aish baladi.<\/span><\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Aish Fino<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A small bread roll similar to a French baguette but softer and lighter.<\/span><\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Aish Merahrah<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A flatbread made from millet flour that is common in rural areas.<\/span><\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Eish Saraya<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: <\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A sweet bread pudding soaked in sugar syrup and topped with nuts and cream.<\/span><\/span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\">\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><b>Feteer Meshaltet<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">:<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\r\n<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> A flaky pastry made from thin dough brushed with butter or ghee and baked in an oven.

If you wish to see the pyramids, cruise the Nile, or relax on the beach, Egypt has something for everyone. However, planning a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wiki\/egypt-travel-tips\/the-best-places-to-visit-in-egypt\/\">family vacation in Egypt<\/a>\u00a0can be challenging, especially if you have different ages and interests in your group. Here are some tips and answers to frequently asked questions to help you plan a successful and memorable family vacation in Egypt.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Is Egypt A Good Destination For Families<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66913 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Is-Egypt-A-Good-Destination-For-Families.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYes, Egypt is a good destination for families, as it offers a variety of activities and experiences that can suit different tastes and preferences. You can learn about ancient history and civilization at the museums and archaeological sites, enjoy the scenic views and wildlife on the Nile cruise, have fun and adventure in the desert and the Red Sea, and experience the local culture and cuisine in the cities and villages. Egypt is also a relatively affordable destination, with many options for accommodation, transportation, and tours that can fit your budget.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Is Egypt Suitable For Seniors<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66914 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Is-Egypt-suitable-for-seniors_.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYes, Egypt is suitable for seniors, as long as they are in good health and have no mobility issues. Most of the attractions in Egypt are accessible by car or bus, and some guides and assistants can help you along the way. However, some places may require walking on uneven terrain or climbing stairs, such as the pyramids, the Valley of the Kings, or the temples. You should also be aware of the weather conditions, especially the heat and the sun, and drink plenty of water and wear sunscreen. If you have any medical conditions or special needs, you should consult your doctor before traveling and bring your medication and prescriptions.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>When is the best time to visit\u00a0<\/strong>Egypt?<\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66938 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/When-is-the-best-time-to-visit-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"When is the best time to visit Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n<div>\r\n\r\nThe best time to visit Egypt is from October to April when the weather is cooler and more comfortable. Avoid the peak season of December and January, when higher prices and crowds are larger. The summer months of May to September are very hot and dry, making sightseeing difficult and unpleasant. However, if you don\u2019t mind the heat, you can find cheaper deals and fewer tourists during this time.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">How Many Days Should I Stay in Egypt?<\/h2>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66939\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/How-many-days-should-I-stay-in-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"How many days should I stay in Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/><\/h2>\r\n<\/div>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question depends on how much you want to see and do in Egypt. A typical itinerary for a family vacation in Egypt would cover the main attractions of Cairo, Luxor, Aswan, and Hurghada in about 10 to 14 days. However, you can extend or shorten your trip according to your interests and budget. For example, you can add more days to explore other destinations, such as Alexandria, Sharm El Sheikh, or Siwa Oasis, or skip some places if you want to focus on one or two regions.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Can I Expect to Do on A Nile Cruise?<\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66940 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/What-can-I-expect-to-do-on-a-Nile-Cruise.jpg\" alt=\"What can I expect to do on a Nile Cruise\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nA Nile Cruise is one of the best ways to experience the beauty and history of Egypt. You can sail along the longest river in the world on a traditional felucca or a luxury boat, and stop at various ancient sites. You can visit the temples of Karnak and Luxor, the Valley of the Kings, the Temple of Hatshepsut, the Colossi of Memnon, the Temple of Kom Ombo, the Temple of Edfu, the Temple of Philae, and the Aswan High Dam. You can also enjoy the scenic views of the riverbanks, watch the sunset over the water, see crocodiles and birds on the islands, and experience the local culture and cuisine on board.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Safety And Health of My Family During Trip to Egypt<\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66942\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Safety-And-Health-Of-My-Family-During-Trip-To-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Safety And Health Of My Family During Trip To Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/><\/p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEgypt is generally a safe and hospitable country, but you should still take some precautions to avoid any problems or risks during your trip. Here are some tips on how to stay safe and healthy in Egypt :\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"2\">Follow the travel advice from your government and avoid any areas affected by political unrest or violence. You can check the latest updates and warnings on their websites or apps.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"2\">Be aware of scams and touts that may try to overcharge you or sell you fake products or services. Do not accept any offers or invitations from strangers, and always negotiate the price before agreeing to anything. You can also ask your hotel or tour operator for recommendations or referrals.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"2\">Be careful of pickpockets and thieves that may target tourists in crowded or busy places. Keep your valuables and documents safely, or carry them in a hidden pouch or bag. Refrain from flaunting your money or jewelry or leaving your belongings unattended.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"2\">Drink only bottled water and avoid ice cubes or tap water. The water quality in Egypt could be better and may cause stomach problems or infections. You should avoid raw or uncooked food, such as salads, fruits, or seafood, and only eat at reputable restaurants or hotels.<\/li>\r\n \t<li aria-level=\"2\">Bring sunscreen, insect repellent, and medication for common ailments. The sun in Egypt can be very strong and cause sunburns or heat strokes. You should also protect yourself from mosquitoes and other insects that may carry diseases such as malaria or dengue fever. You should also bring medication for headaches, diarrhea, nausea, or allergies and any prescription drugs you need.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66607 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" \/>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Souvenirs And Gifts from\u00a0Egypt<\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-66943\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Souvenirs-And-Gifts-From-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Souvenirs And Gifts From Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEgypt has a rich and diverse culture and produces many unique and beautiful souvenirs and gifts you can buy for your family and friends.

Here are some tips on when to go, where to go, what to know, and how to enjoy Egypt.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Why should you visit Egypt?<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-66127 lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Why-should-you-visit-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Why should you visit Egypt\" width=\"688\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/10\/Why-should-you-visit-Egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\nEgypt has the famous Pyramids of Giza and many other amazing temples and historical sites. The food is also unique and delicious. And don\u2019t forget the Nile River, a world-renowned attraction and symbol of Egypt, and down below. You are going to know how to plan a tour to Egypt.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Facts You Should Know About Egypt<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66712 aligncenter ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Facts-You-Should-Know-about-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Facts You Should Know About Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Facts-You-Should-Know-about-Egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile you Plan Tour to Egypt, You have to consider Water \u2013 Don\u2019t drink the tap water. It has too much chlorine. Use bottled water instead.\r\n\r\n<strong>Hydration<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Stay hydrated. The desert is very hot, and you can lose a lot of water. Drink plenty of water and bring electrolyte tablets for extra energy.\r\n\r\n<strong>Currency<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 The currency is the Egyptian pound, written \u00a3E or LE. It has smaller units called piastres. Learn the difference between the notes before you go.\r\n\r\n<strong>Expect to pay<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Bring enough change with you, especially for the popular places. You can take pictures with camels or temples, but the owners will ask for money.\r\n\r\n<strong>Comfortable Clothing<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Wear cotton clothes that are loose and comfortable. You are in the desert, and it\u2019s very hot. You can get sunburned, dehydrated, or heat-exhausted. Carry water with you.\r\n\r\n<strong>Avoid the Crowds<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 If you don\u2019t like crowds, go to the pyramids in the afternoon when there are fewer people. Most tourists go to the pyramids first and then to the Khan el-Khalili and Egyptian Museum. You can go to the museum after 11-12 pm when it\u2019s less crowded.\r\n\r\n<strong>Khan el-Khalili<\/strong>\u00a0\u2013 Don\u2019t buy everything you see. Egypt has many beautiful things, but save your money for Khan el-Khalili. There are many items at reasonable prices. The sellers are friendly and will make your shopping fun and easy.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"wpb_single_image wpb_content_element vc_align_center\">\r\n<figure class=\"wpb_wrapper vc_figure\">\r\n<div class=\"vc_single_image-wrapper   vc_box_border_grey\"><img class=\"vc_single_image-img attachment-full ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"856\" height=\"60\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Line.png\" \/><\/div><\/figure>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Best Time to Visit Egypt<\/strong><\/h2>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<img class=\"size-full wp-image-66716 aligncenter ls-is-cached lazyloaded\" src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Best-Time-to-Visit-Egypt.jpg\" alt=\"Best Time to Visit Egypt\" width=\"870\" height=\"430\" data-src=\"https:\/\/sunpyramidstours.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/Best-Time-to-Visit-Egypt.jpg\" \/>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf you want to Plan A Trip to Egypt, we\u2019ve got two main vacation times. The first one, what we call the \u201cChristmas Season,\u201d kicks off at the end of December. You can check out our stunning attractions during this time. But if you want to steer clear of the big crowds, consider planning your trip for mid-October through mid-November. The weather is fantastic, and prices are more budget-friendly compared to the Christmas season.\r\n\r\nThe second busy season is during Easter in April, and it\u2019s highly recommended for an amazing tour experience. You can enjoy one of our fantastic Egypt Easter tours and have the adventure you\u2019ve been longing for.
